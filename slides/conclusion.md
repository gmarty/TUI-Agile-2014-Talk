# To CI
## and beyond!

---

# Better CI

* Keep the build fast:
    * Paralleled test running
    * Develop, build, test on a per module basis
* Build on commit & nightly
* Communicate metrics to the team

Note:
CI done the right way

---

# TDD
## Test-driven development

---

1. Write tests
2. Write code

---

# BDD
## Behavior-driven development

---

Similar to TDD, but for non-technical people too.

---

# CD
## Continuous Delivery

---

# Mantra of CD

> Ship early, ship often

---

Small, incremental changes are pushed to production continuously.

---

## Widely used on web projects

At Google, Github, startups...

Note:
At Google, code goes live 8 minutes after being checked in!

---

## Iterate at a fast pace

---

# Track visual regressions

Compare screenshots before / after code commit

Note:
Address the problem of layout checking automation.

---

# A/B Testing

---

CI helps A/B Testing in minimising the testing effort.

---

Push new version to a subset of all users

---

Deploy, test, improve

Rinse and repeat

Note:
"Test" as in test against your audience
